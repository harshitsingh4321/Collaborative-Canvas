## 🔧 How It Works

### 🖌️ Drawing Synchronization

1. **Local Drawing**: User draws on their canvas (instant feedback)
2. **Stroke Broadcast**: Stroke data sent to server via WebSockets
3. **Server Relay**: Server broadcasts to all users in the room
4. **Remote Rendering**: Other clients draw the exact same stroke

```javascript
// Stroke data structure
{
  fromX, fromY,      // Start position
  toX, toY,          // End position
  color,             // Stroke color
  width,             // Stroke width
  tool,              // brush/eraser/line/rectangle/circle
  strokeId,          // Unique identifier for undo/redo
  userId             // User who created the stroke
}
```

### ↩️ Undo/Redo System

- Each stroke group has a unique `strokeId`
- Server maintains complete drawing history per room
- Per-user redo stacks for undone strokes
- On undo: Server removes user's last stroke group
- Server broadcasts updated full history to all clients
- Clients redraw entire canvas from history

### 👆 Cursor Tracking

- Client sends mouse/touch position every frame
- Server broadcasts position to all other users
- Each user sees colored cursors with usernames
- Cursors are color-coded per user for easy identification

### 🏠 Room Management

- Room IDs: 12-character alphanumeric codes
- Server stores: room name, capacity, users, drawing history
- Automatic room deletion when last user leaves
- New users receive full drawing history on join

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Cannot connect to server

**Symptoms**: "Connection Failed" message, drawings not syncing

**Solutions**:
- Ensure server is running (`npm start`)
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify firewall isn't blocking WebSocket connections
- Try a different browser
- Check server URL in `canvas.js` (line 96)

### ❌ Undo not working

**Symptoms**: Undo button doesn't remove strokes

**Possible Causes**:
- Undo only affects **your own strokes**, not others'
- Requires active WebSocket connection
- Check if you have any strokes to undo

**Solutions**:
- Verify connection status in bottom info bar
- Check browser console for errors
- Refresh page and reconnect

### ❌ Cursor not visible

**Symptoms**: Can't see other users' cursors

**Solutions**:
- Cursors appear only when users move their mouse
- User may have left the room (cursor removed)
- Refresh the page
- Check if user is actually in the same room

### ❌ Drawing lag or delay

**Symptoms**: Strokes appear slowly or choppy

**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection
- Server may be under heavy load (free tier limitations)
- Try drawing with smaller brush size
- Reduce number of concurrent users

### ❌ Canvas not clearing

**Symptoms**: Clear button doesn't work

**Solutions**:
- Requires WebSocket connection
- Check if you have permission (any user can clear)
- Refresh page if issue persists

### ❌ Room full error

**Symptoms**: Cannot join room

**Solutions**:
- Room has reached maximum capacity
- Ask host to increase room capacity when creating
- Create a new room instead
